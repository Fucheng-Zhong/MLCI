# Machine Learning Cosmology Inferencer

## Overview

- **MLCI** (**Machine Learning Cosmology Inferencer**) is a machine learning framework designed to infer cosmological parameters from observed galaxy cluster features.

- Based on **Random Forest**, and the galaxy cluser features of **[Magneticum](http://www.magneticum.org/)**, **[eROSITA](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA)**, MLCI aims to explore the relationship between simulated and observable properties of galaxy clusters, and how these relate to the underlying cosmological parameters.

## Features
- Based on mock data from the *Magneticum* simulation and *eROSITA* observation.
- Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests) for cosmological parameter inference  
- Designed to be extensible to multiple datasets and inference methods  

## Goal
- To infer key cosmological parameters (e.g., $h_0, \Omega_b, \Omega_m, \sigma_8$) from galaxy cluster observations using modern machine learning techniques.
